You’ve learned a lot of properties to modify text on a web page!

In the next exercise, you’ll set some text to be *serif* and some text to be *sans-serif*. What exactly do these words mean?

1. Serif — fonts that have extra details on the ends of each letter. Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others.

2. Sans-Serif — fonts that do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. Instead, letters have straight, flat edges, like Arial or Helvetica.
