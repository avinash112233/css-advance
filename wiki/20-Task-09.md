1. Below the banner, the web page is made of three main font sections, Serif, Sans-Serif and Monospace. Each of these sections shows an example font, Garamond, Helvetica, and Space Mono, respectively.

   We’ll focus on styling the Garamond section here. In **typography.css**, in the “Font Card” section, create the selector `.garamond .sample .text`.

2. Using the selector you just created, set the font to `Garamond` and add `serif` as a fallback font.

3. In **typography.css**, below the last selector you made, create the selector `.helvetica .sample .text`.

4. Using the selector you just created, set the font to `Helvetica` and add `sans-serif` as a fallback font.
