1. To see `minmax()` in action, we need to first make the grid have a variable width. Delete the `width` property from `.grid`.

   If you resize your browser, you will see the grid change size with the window.

2. Using `minmax()`, change the second column to be between 50 pixels and 300 pixels.

   Try resizing your browser window. What happens to the other columns when the second column reaches the 300 pixel limit?
