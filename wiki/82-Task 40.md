1. In **flexShrink.css**, Assign `.top.side` a `flex-shrink` value of `2`.

   Stretch and shrink the browser. Because the default value for `flex-shrink` is `1`, the `.top.center` div will shrink but not as much as the `.side` divs.
2. In **flexShrink.css**, Assign `.middle.side` a `flex-shrink` value of `0`.

   Stretch and shrink the browser. How do the `.middle` divs resize differently than the `.top` divs?
3. In **flexShrink.css**, Assign the `.bottom.center` div a `flex-shrink` value of `2`.

   Shrink and stretch the browser again. How do the `.bottom` divs resize differently than the `.top` and `.middle` divs?
