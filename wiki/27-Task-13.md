Now switch to the **Grid-template** directory in the current repository. From now, all the task will be executed in this directory

1. To start, look at **index.html**  to see all seven items in the grid. The grid container is of class `grid`.

2. Back in **stylesheet.css**, in the rule set for elements that have the class `grid`, set the `display` property to `grid`.

   Right now, we haven’t specified the number of rows or columns in our grid, so every item is sitting on a new row. We’ll learn how to structure grid rows and columns in the next couple of exercises.
