Now switch to the **Practice** directory in the current repository. All the task will be executed in this directory


1. Let’s start by making this bunch of divs into a grid. Set the `display` property of the div with class `grid` to the value necessary to make it a CSS grid.


2. Structure the grid to have four columns — the first two each taking up `25%` of the total width, the third column taking up two-thirds of the remaining space, and the last column taking up the last third of the remaining space.

3. Give the grid two rows, both `200px` in size.


4. Put a `10px` gap in between the rows of the grid and a `15px` gap in between the columns of the grid with a single line property.


5. Make the box with class `a` take up the first two columns of the grid.


6. Make the box with class `a` take up the first two rows of the grid.


7. Great! Now, feel free to play around with refactoring to see how short you can make your **practice.css** file while not changing the layout we’ve created. When you’re ready, move on to the next lesson. In the next lesson, you will learn some advanced techniques to further style your CSS grids.
