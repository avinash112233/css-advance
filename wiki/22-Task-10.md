1. Once you have viewed the video, repeat these steps in the browser on your desktop computer, selecting the `Space Mono` font specifying both the regular (`400`) and bold (`700`) `font-weight`s.

2. In the previous exercise, you surfaced the link to the `Space Mono` font specifying both the normal (`400`) and bold (`700`) font weights.

   In **typography.html** include this font in the project using the `<link>` tag.

3. In **typography.css**, in the “Font Card” section, create the selector `.space .sample .text`.

4. Using the selector you just created, set the font to `"Space Mono"` and add `monospace` as a fallback font.
