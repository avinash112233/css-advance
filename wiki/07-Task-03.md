1. The web page features three sections, “Garamond”, “Helvetica”, and “Space Mono”. Each of these sections includes a line with the name of the font creator, such as “Claude Garamond”.

   Let’s italicize the creator’s name on each of these cards. In **typography.css**, in the font card section, set the font style of `.font-card .creator` to italic.

   Notice the font change from normal to italic on the web page.
