1. In **index.html** add a third item to the grid. Make sure this item is of class `box` and `c`.

2. In **stylesheet.css**, create a rule set for class c. Use `grid-area` to make this item take up the eighth column and rows six, seven and eight. Use `span` for both ending values.

3. Letâ€™s refactor our code for the other two items in the grid. Start with item `a`. Replace `grid-row` and `grid-column` with `grid-area`. Again, use `span` to set the end of the rows and columns.

4. Do the same refactoring for item `b` using `grid-area`. Make sure the item still takes up the same amount of space.
