Now switch to the **Grid-template-areas** directory in the current repository. From now, all the task will be executed in this directory

1. In **gridArea.css**, add the `grid-template-areas` property to the `.container` rule set.

   Its value should create a 2-column, 4-row layout with these areas:

* header (spans two columns in the first row)
* nav (spans two columns in the second row)
* left (spans one column on the left in the third row)
* right (spans one column on the right in the third row)
* footer (spans two columns in the fourth row)


2. In the `header` rule set in **gridArea.css**, set the `grid-area` property to `header`.

3. Follow the same pattern for the `nav`, `.left`, `.right`, and `footer` rule sets in **gridArea.css**.

4. Use the `grid-template-columns` property to make the first column 200 pixels wide and the second column 400 pixels wide.

5. In the `.container` rule-set, use the `grid-template-rows` property to make the rows 150 pixels, 200 pixels, 600 pixels, and 200 pixels tall.
