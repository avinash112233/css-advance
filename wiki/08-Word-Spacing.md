You can also increase the spacing between words in a body of text, technically known as word spacing.

To do so, you can use the `word-spacing` property:

```css
h1 {
  word-spacing: 0.3em;
}
```

The default amount of space between words is usually `0.25em`. In the example above, the word spacing is set to `0.3em`, which represents an increase of only `.05em` in word spacing.

Itâ€™s not common to increase the spacing between words, but it may help enhance the readability of bolded or enlarged text. Note, again, that the preferred unit is `em`.
