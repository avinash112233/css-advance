You’ve learned how to increase the spacing between lines of text and words, but it’s possible to get even more detailed: increasing the spacing between individual letters.

The technical term for adjusting the spacing between letters is called tracking. Tracking can be adjusted with the `letter-spacing` property in CSS.

```css
h1 {
  letter-spacing: 0.3em;
}
```

Like word spacing, it’s not common to increase the tracking in text, but sometimes it enhances the readability of uppercase text.
