1. In the `.left` rule set in **overlay.css**, add the `grid-area` property and set its value to `4 / 1 / 9 / 5`.

2. In the `.right` rule set in **overlay.css**, add the `grid-area` property and set its value to `4 / 5 / 9 / 7`.

3. In the `.overlap` rule set in **overlay.css**, add the `grid-area` property.

   Set its value so that the `overlap` element spans the 6th and 7th rows and the 4th and 5th columns.

   Remember, the `grid-area` property accepts 4 values: grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end.


4. Notice that the `overlap` element is covered by the `right` element.

   Set the `z-index` of the `overlap` element to `5`.

5. In the `footer` rule set in **overlay.css**, add the `grid-area` property and set its value to `9 / 1 / 13 / 7`.
