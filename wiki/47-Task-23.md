1. Let’s add another item to our grid. In **index.html**, add another `div` of class `box` and `b` inside the grid `div`.

2. Let’s make box `b` take up six columns. In **stylesheet.css**, create a rule for elements of class b. Use `grid-column` to set its starting column to `2`. Use `span` to make the item take up six columns.

3. Let’s also make box `b` take up a few rows. Use `grid-row` with `span` to make the item take up rows two through four.

4. Now let’s go back to box `a` and refactor the value of the `grid-column` property using the keyword `span`. The grid item should still start in the first column and span 2 columns.
