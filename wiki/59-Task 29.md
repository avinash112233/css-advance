1. Expand the web browser to the right. You might notice that the two columns of recipe cards are off-center.

   Add the `justify-content` property to the `main` rule set in **savory.css** and set its value to `space-between`.



2. Change the value of the `justify-content` property in the `main` to `space-around`.

   Expand the browser again. Now what happened to the columns?

3. Change the value of the `justify-content` property in the `main` to `end`.

   Expand the browser again to see the differences.

4. Change the value of the `justify-content` property in the `main` to `center`.

Expand the browser again to see the differences. Now, all of the elements should be perfectly centered on the page!

Feel free to try any of the values that we didnâ€™t practice.
