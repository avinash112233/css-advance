1. In the **fonts/** directory, you’ll notice that we have added several local font files.

   Let’s change the typography of the banner, using local font files. If you open up the fonts/ directory using the file navigator in the code editor, you’ll notice that we have added local font files `Nexa-Bold.otf` and `Nexa-Light.otf`.

   At the top of **typography.css**, create a selector using the `@font-face` property and give it the font family `Nexa`.

2. Within the `@font-face` rule, add a `src` attribute with the relative path of the file `Nexa-Light.otf` and a `format` of `truetype`. Make sure to include this path in the `url()` parentheses.

3. Using the selector that targets the paragraph nested within the `banner` class, add the font family `Nexa` and a font size of `20px`.
